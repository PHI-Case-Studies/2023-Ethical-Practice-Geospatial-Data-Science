        The solution below is based on:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24427828/calculate-point-based-on-distance-and-direction

        This computes a destination (geomasked) point based on random bearing and distance 
            from origin point.

        Parameters:
        band_range (list of two tuples): first tuple is range of min distance 
            and second tuple is range of max distance in meters
        orig_point (tuple): Tuple of latitude and latitude of origin point

        Returns:
        geomask_dict: dictionary containing:
            destination latitude
            destination longitude
            bearing (in degrees)
